# Running ba_pipeline

**Step 1:**

**_FOR WINDOWS_** - Open an Anaconda PowerShell Prompt window (make sure this is specifically this application - some other command prompt windows make look similar but they won't work). An image of this application is shown below.

**_FOR MAC OR LINUX_** - Open a terminal window. An image of this application is shown below.

**Step 2:**
Activate the program environment with the following command:

```zsh
conda activate ba_env
```

**Step 3:**
Navigate to the folder where you have (or would like to store) your Jupyter Notebook to analyse experiments with.
This can be done with the following command:

```zsh
cd /path/to/my_notebooks_folder
```

**Step 4:**
Open a Jupyter-Lab server with the following command.

```zsh
jupyter-lab
```

**Step 5:**
To access the Jupyter-Lab server to interact with the `ba_pipeline` program, open a browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, FireFox, Brave, Opera) and enter the following URL:

```zsh
http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab
```

An example of how the Jupyter Notebook should look like is shown in the figure below.

</p>

**Step 6:**
Please ensure that it the "ba_env" kernel is used.
To change the notebook's kernel to "ba_env", select "Kernel" > "Change Kernel..." in the top left menu bar. Then select the "ba_env" from the prompt.

**Step 7:**
You can now use the `ba_pipeline` program through a Jupyter Notebook. For how to use this, please see the [tutorials](../../tutorials/usage_examples/one_project.md).
